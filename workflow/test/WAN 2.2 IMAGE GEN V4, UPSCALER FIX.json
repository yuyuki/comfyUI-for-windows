Its massive, slightly tattered black sails are fully unfurled, catching the warm, golden light of the setting sun, which hangs low on the horizon. From the mainmast, a large, tattered black Jolly Roger flag, featuring a classic skull and crossbones, billows dramatically in the wind. The sunlight glistens on the wet deck and creates a brilliant, fiery reflection on the water's surface. Beneath the ship, the dark fins of several large sharks can be seen subtly cutting through the surface of the water, escorting the vessel. The shot is captured from a low angle at sea level, emphasizing the ship's immense scale and power against the vast, colorful sky.

Although i have done these tests, it may not be the best value for your target image,just tried to find general value for everyone.Visual consistency is not 100% as a result.

Shot from a low-angle, rear three-quarter view, its iconic quad circular taillights are illuminated and glowing a vibrant red, with its Ontario license plate reading \"CXTC 719\" clearly visible. The entire scene is bathed in the warm, magical light of the setting sun on the horizon, which creates a soft lens flare and casts gentle shadows across the asphalt and its painted white lines. The photographic style renders the car with extreme clarity and tack-sharp focus, drawing all attention to its details, while the background elements of light poles and a commercial building recede into a soft, atmospheric distance, creating a cinematic, masterpiece-quality image with a calm and beautiful atmosphere.The whole photo is like early 2010s snapshot photo captured with a phone and

It is impossible and always will be that way.\n\nLet me tell you the logic :\n\nWe upscale the latent and Resample it with Highnoise sampler at first phase with low denoise, it is because we do not want a new image, 0.62 is the value i am using so let's talk what will happen if you change that:\n\nIf you lower first sampler's denoise you'll get more noisy image. But more consistent image as for the first pass, the noise amount can broke your image or make more consistent depending on the target image.\n\nIf you make higher first sampler's denoise, you'll get less noisy image, less consistent image (But can do a complete new image, which is not desired.)\n\nWhat will be the effect of this change to the second sampler? It is significant. The second sampler uses low noise model, but denoise is lower and it gets the latent from high noise pass, what is it mean? It means if the first sampler's noise amount is higher so the output will be more noisy.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nLet's talk about second sampler's denoise level, it is even more important because it gets reference from noisy latent (first pass.),What about changing second sampler's denoise? so if you lower the denoise it get's more reference that means more noisy, (sometimes more detailed image) will be result. What if we make it higher? it is starting to get more freedom and tries to make new image completely, it has a breaker level that makes complete different image, assuming that level to be 0.65-0.70.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nSo a portrait and landscape photo is complete different and its different best values exist for them, it is hard to get the best result with the same settings, sometimes you need to play with the values. If you get the logic, it is easy to play from that point.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nHowever, we have now a new problem, it is contrast. Contrast of the image is higher than the input. It has no fix for now, i will put color match which can helps little to solve that problem. But still it exists.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nYou can try to make different version of this with Clownshark samplers, but you have to play with eta values, it can generate different results.
